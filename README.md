Portfolio Risk Analysis Tool

This Python program offers a comprehensive analysis of investment portfolio risk through various indicators and simulations. Whether you're assessing an existing portfolio or considering different investment options, this tool provides valuable insights to inform your decision-making process.

Features
Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation

Historical VaR: Calculate VaR using historical returns for the selected portfolio.
Simulation VaR: Simulate portfolio returns to estimate VaR using Monte Carlo simulation.
Monte Carlo Simulation

Simulate portfolio performance over a specified period using Monte Carlo simulation.
Explore potential outcomes and probabilities based on 10,000 simulation runs.
Markowitz Portfolio Optimization

Generate an efficient frontier to identify optimal portfolios based on risk and return.
Utilize Modern Portfolio Theory principles to construct well-balanced portfolios.
How to Use
Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Running the Program

Execute main.py to launch the Streamlit web application.
Access the program through your web browser.
Input Selection

Choose the analysis option (VaR calculation, Monte Carlo simulation, or Markowitz optimization).
Specify the portfolio composition (list of stocks and respective weights).
Output Interpretation

Review the calculated risk metrics, simulation results, and optimized portfolio weights.
Interpret visualizations such as histograms, line charts, and scatter plots to understand portfolio risk and return characteristics.
